# Happy thoughts Project

Technigo Week 6 Group Project
Daniel Read, Michael Holm, and Ayumi Gorbacheva-Yamamoto

The assignment was to create an X (formerly Twitter)-like app to fetch and post happy thoughts.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started by each taking an initial task: listing the fetched thoughts, creating a form to post new thoughts, and implementing the like button on existing thoughts. Other tasks and stretch goals were then worked on in individual branches.

This project was good for practice using the useEffect hook and further practice on using state.
